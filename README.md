# Psychic-Game
The Psychic Game is a simple JavaScript game that allows the user to guess the letter the computer chooses.
The user can choose a letter between A-Z.
The user has 15 guesses after which the game will be reset to zero.
The users losses, wins, guesses left and guesses so far are displayed on the screen so the player can keep track of their progress as they play.
Enjoy the game and see if you can beat the computer!
